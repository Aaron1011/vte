//! Parser for implementing virtual terminal emulators
//!
//! [`Parser`] is implemented according to [Paul Williams' ANSI parser
//! state machine]. The state machine doesn't assign meaning to the parsed data
//! and is thus not itself sufficient for writing a terminal emulator. Instead,
//! it is expected that an implementation of [`Perform`] is provided which does
//! something useful with the parsed data. The [`Parser`] handles the book
//! keeping, and the [`Perform`] gets to simply handle actions.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! For an example of using the [`Parser`] please see the examples folder. The example included
//! there simply logs all the actions [`Perform`] does. One quick thing to see it in action is to
//! pipe `vim` into it
//!
//! ```ignore
//! cargo build --release --example parselog
//! vim | target/release/examples/parselog
//! ```
//!
//! Just type `:q` to exit.
